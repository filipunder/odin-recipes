    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Fig Spread:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup finely chopped droed figs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cider vinegar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup minced white onion</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground cloves</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Crostini:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) loaf French bread, cut into 1-inch slices</li>
      <li>olive oil cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) round Brie cheese, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
      <li>1 Granny Smith apple, cut into matchstick-size pieces</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine figs, vinegar, brown sugar, onion, ginger, garlic powder, cayene
        pepper, cloves, and cinnamon in a saucepan; simmer over low heat,
        stirring occasionally, until fig spread is reduced, about 30 minutes.
        Transfer fig spread to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate,
        8 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's
        broiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet. Lightly spray both sides of each
        bread slice with olive oil cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake bread slices under the broiler until toasted, about 2 minutes per
        side. Remove bread from oven and cool slightly, keeping broiler on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend fig spread in blender or a food processor until pureed. Spread
        about 1 teaspoon fig spread onto each toasted bread slice; top with Brie
        cheese and apple pieces. Sprinkle each crostini with oregano.
      </li>
      <li>
        Broil crostini in the preheated oven until Brie cheese is melted and
        browned, 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
